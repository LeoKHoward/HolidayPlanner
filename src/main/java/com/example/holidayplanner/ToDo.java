    Code it to give suggested start date and end date of given project

    This is based on availability of required roles (BAs/TAs/Devs) in project and their annual leave dates

    Ideally wont include any holidays

    If there is no free period, it should make other suggestions, and say how many days will be lost,
    and calculate when the project end date will be, taking into account lost days

    If project runs over bank holiday then state which one and what date(s)

    Specify how many of each role required in project

    Specify the expected length of days for project to take (excluding bank holidays and weekends)

    Output will show suggested start/end date, names/details of team members, highlight any holidays during project
    time including bank holidays
