    If one employee (e.g. a BA) isn't available, get next one of same role
    If both unavailable, move project start date

    If one BA for example isn't free for one week of project but another BA is then get the second BA to fill
    in perhaps whilst BA 1 is on leave?

    If there is no free period, it should make other suggestions, and say how many days will be lost,
    and calculate when the project end date will be, taking into account lost days
